1) Create and initialization database:                  |
    flask --app pr1 init-db                             |
                                                        | pr1 - name app catalog
2) Start app server (flask server)                      |
    flask --app pr1 --debug run                         |
                                                        |
3) Install project in the virtual environment.          | pip list --> pr1 in in installed
This tells pip to find setup.py in the current          |
directory and install it in editable or development     |
mode. Editable mode means that as you make changes      |
to your local code, youâ€™ll only need to re-install      |
if you change the metadata about the project, such      |
as its dependencies.                                    |
                                                        |
    pip install -e .            --project               |
